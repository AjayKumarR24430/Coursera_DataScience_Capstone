# The Battle of Neighborhoods Report

## Introduction/ Business Problem

The proposed idea of study is to help someone who is planning to open a big restaurant or a hotel in Toronto. Before starting, one has to look into the neighborhoods, the current trends, income of the people, the population in that area and income of different communities. The owner has to set the audience and describe the audience's problem and how to solve it optimally. Most importantly, the planner has to find out their competitors in that area and find how they have been functioning in the past. Therefore, the person has to find the right location to set up his/her restaurant that would maximize his profit as well as benefit the surrounding.
