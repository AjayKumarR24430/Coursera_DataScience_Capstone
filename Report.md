# The Battle of Neighborhoods Report

## Introduction/ Business Problem

The proposed idea of study is to help someone who is planning to open a big restaurant or a hotel in Toronto. Before starting, one has to look into the neighborhoods, the current trends, income of the people, the population in that area and income of different communities. The owner has to set the audience and describe the audience's problem and how to solve it optimally. Most importantly, the planner has to find out their competitors in that area and find how they have been functioning in the past. Therefore, the person has to find the right location to set up his/her restaurant that would maximize his profit as well as benefit the surrounding.

## Data Description and Preparation

Data about Toronto's venues, neighborhood, latitudes, longitudes and category of the venues are to be taken and have to be prepared for the next process. The data can be found in this link: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-developer-skills-network/yczvh-DataFilesForIBMProjects/master/segmenting_neighborhoods.json A person has to find the venue categories from this data and find which has more number of hotels or cafeterias and decide upon the results.

## Target Audience

The person who is planning to open up a restaurant mostly targets the daily workers in that particular area. Target audience is employers who go out to work most days and they must find the restaurant pristine and satisfy their needs. The public, if finds the restaurant more awesome and likes what they offer, will spend a lot of time in this place and try various dishes offered by the restaurant.

## Methodology
After pre-processing the data and seeing the first few values,  the venues are grouped by the neighborhood. One hot encoding is done and the grouped data is seen with respect to the venues. Neighborhood with each common venue is calculated for the person's convenience so that he/she can predict what are the shops and centres that are already there and thus must plan accordingly. This is shown in a table for each of the common venues across all neighborhoods in toronto. The next stage is calculating 10 most number of venues in a table. For eg, for neighborhood Agincourt, there will be 10 most common venues according to the frequencies of their presence in that particular area. These neighborhoods are clustered based on the common venues and the share of the shops. The person who is willing to put up a restaurant will see these parameters of nearby frequently occuring shops and the category of those shops.

## Inference
After looking up the pattern, if the shop owner opens up in a place where the population and income is more and the category he/she is willing to sell is not been visited by the people, the shop will prosper and more profits will be earned. A shop keeper can also open up the shop in a place where there are existing restaurants and people are already loving to go there. But the profit might not be as expected and it will take for the shop to surge and get a reasonable crowd regularly.
